## 🎯 The Problem

**Challenge 5: The Enemy Within**  

> **How might we detect insider threats within banks while preserving employee trust and respecting privacy?**

Insider threats are dangerous because staff already have legitimate access. Current monitoring tools feel like “Big Brother,” creating mistrust, while doing nothing leaves banks exposed.  

---

## ✨ Our Solution

**TrustShield Sentinel** — a privacy-first insider threat detection assistant.  

- Detects unusual staff behavior using **simple, role-based baselines** (not surveillance).  
- Engages employees with **friendly nudges** instead of accusatory alerts.  
- Preserves trust with **privacy safeguards**: anonymized IDs, metadata-only tracking, and transparent alerts.  
- Provides a **dashboard for security teams** showing anonymized risk levels, with identities only revealed if a real threat persists.  

**In short:** Employees become *partners in security*, not suspects.
